# **Audience Rating Prediction with ML Pipeline**

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on predicting **audience ratings** using a machine learning pipeline. The goal is to analyze audience preferences and trends based on historical data. The model follows a structured approach, including data preprocessing, feature transformation, model training, and evaluation. A **Random Forest Regressor** is used to predict audience ratings, ensuring a balance between performance and interpretability.

## **Model Validation & Performance Metrics**
The model successfully captured audience rating trends, although some predictions slightly deviated from actual values. The evaluation metrics are:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: `11.3321`  
- **RÂ² Score**: `0.4589`  

These values indicate that the model performs well in identifying overall audience preferences, though improvements can be made with hyperparameter tuning or additional feature engineering.
